%h1 Editing photo

%p Tell me how you want to edit photos, perhaps something could be done about it. Perhaps some tag editing stuff can go here.


= image_tag @photo.attachment.url(:thumb)

click on link to add tag()
- Tag.all.each do |t|
  = link_to t.name, '#'
  &nbsp;


%br
= link_to 'Show', @photo
\|
= link_to 'Back', photos_path
